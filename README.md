# 3D Design Files for PCB Case
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

This repository contains the 3D design files for a custom PCB case that I designed using Autodesk Fusion 360. The case consists of several parts that come together to securely encase the PCB.

Here's a preview of what the assembled case looks like:

## PCB Design Files

The PCB that fits inside this case was designed separately. You can find the PCB design files and related documentation in the [PCB repository](https://github.com/Mohammed-s-PCBs/Smart-Flower).
